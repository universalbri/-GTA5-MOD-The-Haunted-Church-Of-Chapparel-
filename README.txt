This readme is for Haunted Church v1.0

Haunted Church  is a NOVELTY Script, which might be useful if you're making movies or trying to add atmosphere within GTA5, which when installed and enabled will make the Hill Valley Church in Great Chapparal haunted, with thunderstorms and lightning, the dead risen from their graves, and more... 

For a demonstration of this, See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ3qTgQemsU
